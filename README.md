# Ezy_Nav
This repository ("Ezy_Nav") is where I built an application which offers users the best route to get to their destination either by a car or a public transport. Additionally the app provides the weather forecast at the starting and the destination.

* How to use the app:
1. Enter a starting address in "From" input field.(You must enter at least a name of the 'City')
2. Choose a transportation mode.
3. Enter a destination address in "To" input field.(You must enter at least a name of the 'City')
4. Click 'GO!' button.
5. You will see the map with directions, fastest route, weather for both starting address and destination address.


* API 
1. Geocoder (developers.here.com)
2. Driving Routing (developers.here.com)
3. Public Transit Routing (developers.here.com)
4. Weather (openweathermap.org)


The application is fully responsive through Materialize CSS library and interacts through Firebase.
